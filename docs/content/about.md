This services can generate automatically hosts configuration files for [apt-dater](https://github.com/DE-IBH/apt-dater) from [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) targets which get fetched from the regular API. You can use the builtin filter mechanism powered by [Govaluate](https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate) to limit the hosts and to gather the server group, name and address.
