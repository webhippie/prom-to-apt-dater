      <description>This command-line tool can generate automatically host configuration files for apt-dater based on Prometheus targets which get fetched from the regular API. You can use the builtin filter mechanism powered by govaluate to limit the hosts and to gather the server group, name and address.</description>

      <description>Installation So far we are offering only a few different variants for the installation. You can choose between Docker or pre-built binaries which are stored on our download mirror and GitHub releases. Maybe we will also provide system packages for the major distributions later if we see the need for it.
Docker Generally we are offering the images through quay.io/webhippie/prom-to-apt-dater and webhippie/prom-to-apt-dater, so feel free to choose one of the providers.</description>
